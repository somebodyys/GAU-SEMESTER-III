The infinite in both directions stripe with width 1 is divided into blocks of size 1 x 1. 
In one of these blocks the robot is located. It can move from one cell to another 
(the robot at the figure is marked with square). 
Its movements are determined by the program, 
each instruction is given by one of three capital letters: L, R, S. 
The instruction L says the robot to move one cell to the left, 
the instruction R - to move one square right, and S - to stay in the same cell. 
Program execution means the sequential execution of all instruction in it.

The student Vasya has a younger brother Peter, 
who went to the first class and started to learn arithmetic. 
At home in the first class he was asked to solve many problems using addition and subtraction. 
Peter asked Vasya to check the homework. Seeing the two-page written scrawl tests, 
Vasya was horrified by the amount of work and decided to teach Peter to use a computer for self checking. 
To do this, Vasya needs to write a program that computes the answers for the required arithmetic problems.
